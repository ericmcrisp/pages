\lettercontent{Dear \company{}'s Hiring Team,}

\lettercontent{

When I started my career and selected aerospace engineering, it wasn't because I had a passion for traveling to Mars, or landing on the Moon. It was because of a paper I read from Caltech on wireless solar power (SSPP). In part, the authors argued that commercial access to space as an engineering solution to relocate resource, or pollution, intensive industries, such as solar farms, would be a benefit for everyone on earth - a global high impact, net positive solution to a universal problem. I then saw engineering not as path for the mathematically inclined, but rather as a way to help others by solving societies biggest problems  to being in the operating room with a scalpel.

\lettercontent{

Over the past few years, as I took inventory of the engineering landscape, I realized the rate of impact that I was contributing to in the space industry was marginalized by the scale and rate of impact occurring in tech, specifically artificial intelligence. 

Not only are things happening quickly, but things are happening across socioeconomic boundaries, globally. People are being exposed to these technologies, sometimes without even knowing it, putting not only regulations and laws in the hot seat but also placing an enormous ethical responsibility on industry leaders.

}

\lettercontent{

That is why I am applying here. Anthropic is one company that has, from the very beginning, fundamentally realized it's impact and responsibility to the public. This organization has shown commitment to transparency, rigorous safety practices, and cutting edge research time and time again through almost 5 years of publicly available resources, open source development, and a people-first culture that makes me want to continue my career at Anthropic.

}

\lettercontent{

With years of engineering experience, graduate work in data science and machine learning, and a genuine passion for the mission - I am interested in pursuing a role where my effort will be the most impactful and the most useful. Bringing a balance of eagerness, aptitude, and a unique technical background, I hope to find a place to help Anthropic bring ethically sound, high value, and high impact AI solutions to the public including less fortunate and underrepresented regions and communities.
