\lettercontent{Dear \company{},}

\lettercontent{

When I started my career and selected aerospace engineering, it wasn't because I had a passion for traveling to Mars or landing on the Moon. It was because of a paper I read from Caltech on wireless transmission of solar power (SSPP). In part, the authors argued that commercial access to space could be used to relocate resource intensive industries (e.g., solar farming, mining). After reading this paper, I discovered my underlying motivation behind being an engineer: to scale my individual impact by helping to solve large-scale problems that benefit members of society without distinction.

}

\lettercontent{

 I started my career in the lab researching clean combustion hoping to progress the emissions problem. I then joined Blue Origin to help build clean, reusable rockets designed to relocate polluting industries to space. Now, I have shifted my focus towards ethical, safe development of cutting edge AI/ML technologies that will hopefully accomplish two things: help empower individuals across socioeconomic boundaries, and simultaneously develop tools that might help solve critical problems like cancer research, clean energy, and world hunger. 
 
}

\lettercontent{ 
  
With the industry's breakneck development cycle, these transformative technologies are being deployed faster than industry leaders can fully assess their societal impact. As these systems become integrated into daily life, society faces a regulatory lag that puts enormous pressure on industry leaders to self-regulate and consider the broader implications of the innovations.

}

\lettercontent{

From the very beginning, Anthropic has fundamentally realized their impact and responsibility to the public. This organization has shown commitment to transparency, rigorous safety practices, and cutting edge research time and time again through almost five years of publicly available resources, open source development, and even structuring as a PBC.

}

\lettercontent{

With years of engineering experience, graduate work in data science and machine learning, and a deep, personal alignment with Anthropic's mission, I hope to find my place within the Anthropic team and help deliver ethically sound, high value, and high impact AI solutions that serve the public good.
