\lettercontent{Dear \company{}'s Hiring Team,}

\lettercontent{

When I started my career and selected aerospace engineering, it wasn't because I had a passion for traveling to Mars or landing on the Moon. It was because of a paper I read from Caltech on wireless transmission of solar power (SSPP). In part, the authors argued that commercial access to space could be used for relocating resource, or pollution, intensive industries. This is when I discovered my underlying career motivation: engineering can be used to scale my individual impact by helping to solve large-scale problems that benefit members of society without distinction.

}

\lettercontent{

 My career started with years of researching clean combustion hoping to progress the emissions problem. I then joined Blue Origin to help build clean, reusable rockets designed to relocate polluting industries to space. Now, my focus has shifted towards ethical, safe development and implementations of AI technologies that hopefully accomplish two things: empower individuals across socioeconomic boundaries to achieve things that may not have been otherwise feasible, and simultaneously contribute tools that help solve critical problems like cancer research, clean energy, and world hunger. 
 
}

\lettercontent{ 
  
With the field's breakneck development cycle, these transformative technologies are being deployed faster than we can fully assess their societal impact. As these systems become integrated into daily life, we collectively face a regulatory lag that puts enormous pressure on industry leaders to self-regulate and consider the broader implications of the innovations.

}

\lettercontent{

From the very beginning, Anthropic has fundamentally realized their impact and responsibility to the public. This organization has shown commitment to transparency, rigorous safety practices, and cutting edge research time and time again through almost five years of publicly available resources, open source development, and even structuring as a PBC.

}

\lettercontent{

With years of engineering experience, graduate work in data science and machine learning, and a deep, personal alignment with Anthropic's mission, I hope to find my place within the Anthropic team and help deliver ethically sound, high value, and high impact AI solutions that serve the public good.
}
